# Profilepage build on React + TypeScript + Vite

## Run the env
  - Clone the Git repo
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm dev

## Future work
  - File upload save the file and attach it to users
  - Tags updating function
  - Better form validation (Formik, zod are good candidates here)
  - Cleaning up the components more reuseble components

## Thoughts 
I added TailwindCSS, autoprefixer and postCSS to the project for easy styling
I decided to use Typescript eventhough it was not strictly needed for the project prefer having types in my code

## Building the UI
I started breaking down the design to its smaller components in order to creater a list of "Atoms" that I could then develop and build into larger partials. the Idea is to make self contained components that then like Lego clicks together quickly and easy.
